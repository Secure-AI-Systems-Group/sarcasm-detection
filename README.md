## Running The Code

Since this code was written in Google Colab, we recommend checking out the Colab files (links contained in Python code) and copying them. Also, please don't forget to swap out the google drive links in the code with your own google drive links.

## Generating The Embeddings

The embeddings can be generated by following the code [here](Code/iac_v2,_iac_v1,_and_tweets_data_embedding_creation.py). For the A3 embeddings, the fine-tuned BERTweet model can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FKF0TI1RbhTyJtKo3xNUM2wgi-l26ZII/view?usp=sharing or you can fine-tune your own model following the code [here](Code/fine_tuning_bertweet_via_simclr.py).
